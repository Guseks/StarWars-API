The frontend consists of four components:
- A list of current characters in collection
- A input field to add new characters with a specified name together with a button
- A component used for swapping position of two characters in collection
- A component responsible for communicating status messages to the user

### Usage
- The user can attempt to add a character by providing a name of the character they wish to add. If a character with that  
  name exists in the star wars universe it is added to the collection. A status message is displayed to inticate success. 

- By clicking the delete button next to a character in the list the user can remove a character from the collection

- The user can also swap position of two characters by selecting two unique characters from the dropdown lists and clicking the button
